# Qua Media Contracts — Plan & Roadmap

The architectural plan that motivated this repo, plus the phased migration
toward a real backend (`qua-media-rs`) sharing the wire contract with the
mock that lives in `qua-media-pipeline-ui/server`.

---

## The core problem

The UI repo iterates fast against a mock that produces convenient data. The
backend iterates against real concerns: Postgres schemas, Kafka transactions,
FFmpeg edge cases. **If they share nothing, they drift. If they share
everything, they collapse into one repo.**

The answer is a thin shared contract that both repos depend on, plus a swap
point that's smaller than you think.

## The architecture

└──────────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────────────┘
```

The mock server lives in the UI repo. The real server lives in the backend
repo. **Both implement the same contract. The frontend doesn't know which
one it's talking to.**

---

## What goes in this repo

Three artifacts, all generated from one source of truth.

### 1. JSON Schema as the source of truth (`schemas/v1/`)

Each WebSocket message type and HTTP endpoint is a JSON Schema document.
Humans edit these; everything else is generated.

```
schemas/v1/
├── domain.schema.json       # all reusable domain types as $defs
├── ws/
│   ├── server.schema.json   # ServerMessage tagged union (oneOf on `type`)
│   └── client.schema.json   # ClientMessage tagged union (oneOf on `type`)
├── http/
│   └── openapi.yaml         # HTTP API surface
└── examples/
    ├── server/*.json        # conformance fixtures, run by `make validate`
    └── client/*.json
```

> **Original brief listed split files** (`snapshot.schema.json`,
> `state_change.schema.json`, etc.). The implementation merges them into one
> tagged-union document per direction (`ws/server.schema.json`,
> `ws/client.schema.json`) with each variant defined under `$defs/`. This
> makes the discriminator (`type`) literal-checkable in both `oneOf` and
> typify, and it removes a pile of cross-file `$ref`s. Adding a new message
> is a `$defs` entry plus a `oneOf` entry — same friction as a new file.

### 2. Generated TypeScript types (`packages/ts/`)

`json-schema-to-typescript` produces a single `src/index.ts` with every
type. Published as `@qua/media-contracts` (for now: git dep; later: private
npm registry).

### 3. Generated Rust types (`crates/qua-media-contracts/`)

`build.rs` uses [`typify`] to produce structs and tagged enums with
`#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`. `src/generated.rs` is gitignored and
regenerated deterministically every `cargo build`. Published as
`qua-media-contracts` (for now: git dep; later: private cargo registry).

Both the mock server and the real backend depend on the Rust crate. Both
React clients depend on the TS package. **Schema changes break both at
compile time — that's the point.**

---

## Migration path

### Phase 0 — Extract contracts ✅ DONE

Bootstrap this repo. Move every WebSocket message shape into JSON Schema.
Set up codegen for TS + Rust.

**Status:** complete. Both pipelines verified end-to-end.

- 29 server message variants, 10 client message variants, ~60 domain types
- TS gen + validate + tsc all green; cargo build green (~22k LOC generated)
- 4 example messages validate against their schemas in CI

This phase was **risk-free and worth doing immediately** because it forced
formalization of what was previously implicit.

### Phase 1 — Wire contracts into the UI repo ✅ DONE

The UI repo depends on this contract; nothing observable changed.

**Outcome:** both client and mock server now consume the generated
types; CI checks out `qua-media-contracts` as a sibling and builds
`packages/ts/dist/` before the client `npm ci`. The contract is
versioned at `v0.1.0` and published to Cloudsmith (npm + Cargo).

#### 1a. Client (TypeScript) ✅

Uses `"@qua/media-contracts": "file:../../qua-media-contracts/packages/ts"`
locally; CI resolves the same path via the multi-checkout pattern.
`client/src/types/index.ts` re-exports wire types from
`@qua/media-contracts` and extends `WireStageState` with UI-only
`{ history, current_round, last_feedback }`.

**Acceptance gate:** ✅ `npm run build` clean, `ci` workflow green.

#### 1b. Server (Rust mock) ✅

`server/Cargo.toml` declares
`qua-media-contracts = { path = "../../qua-media-contracts/crates/qua-media-contracts", features = ["validate"] }`.
The inline `enum WsMessage` and `enum ClientMessage` were removed from
`server/src/main.rs` and replaced with the generated types from the
crate. Variant constructors and match arms were updated for
PascalCase + tagged-union shapes that typify produces.

**Acceptance gate:** ✅ `cargo build --manifest-path server/Cargo.toml`
clean. The `send()` helper validates every outbound frame against
`contracts::validate::server_message` in debug builds, and the inbound
handler validates client frames — catching schema drift before the UI
ever sees it.

#### 1c. Add the swap point ✅

Wired in `client/src/hooks/usePipeline.ts`:

```ts
const WS_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL ?? "ws://localhost:3001/ws";
```

`VITE_WS_URL` is declared in `client/src/vite-env.d.ts`. Setting
`VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/v1/ws` will point at the real backend
once Phase 2 lands.

#### 1d. Tag the contract `v0.1.0` and publish ✅

Tagged `v0.1.0` and published to **Cloudsmith** (`quadricular/qua-media`):

- `@qua/media-contracts@0.1.0` → `https://npm.cloudsmith.io/quadricular/qua-media/`
- `qua-media-contracts@0.1.0` → Cloudsmith Cargo registry

Downstream repos consume via local path during dev (multi-repo checkout
pattern in CI) and can switch to registry deps when desired. The
`publish.yml` workflow ships a new pair on every `v*` tag.

### Phase 2 — Backend builds against contracts (qua-media-rs) 🚧 IN PROGRESS

**Vertical slice landed (commit [`3ecf215`](https://github.com/danielmgzzg/qua-media-pipeline/commit/3ecf215)) and extended (commits [`30951b9`](https://github.com/danielmgzzg/qua-media-pipeline/commit/30951b9), [`adbe9f3`](https://github.com/danielmgzzg/qua-media-pipeline/commit/adbe9f3), [`22f9bbf`](https://github.com/danielmgzzg/qua-media-pipeline/commit/22f9bbf)):**

- `qua-api` now mounts `GET /v1/ws[?run_id=<uuid>]` (outside `AuthLayer` during the
  mock-→-real transition) — see
  [`crates/api/src/routes/ws.rs`](https://github.com/danielmgzzg/qua-media-pipeline/blob/main/crates/api/src/routes/ws.rs).
- The handler bridges existing backend signals to the contract wire
  format:
  - polls `workflow_events` (replay last ~200 on connect, then poll
    every ~750 ms) and translates `stage_started` / `stage_finished` /
    `approval_recorded` / `artifact_published` / `run_completed`
    rows into their contract `ServerMessage` counterparts;
  - samples `WorkerRegistry` every ~2 s and emits one
    `ServerMessage::WorkerHeartbeat` per known worker;
  - when `?run_id=` is provided, emits a `ServerMessage::Snapshot`
    as the **first frame** on connect, populated with real DB data
    (`episode_runs` → `RunState`, `run_stages` + `stage_attempts`
    count → `Vec<StageState>`, `WorkerRegistry` → `Vec<Worker>`);
    all media-domain fields (audio, compositor, eye-alignment, …) are
    stubbed with empty / zero values — the contract requires all 21
    fields and these are genuinely unavailable at the API tier;
  - when `?run_id=` is provided, event replay and polling are also
    filtered to that run only (via the indexed `run_id` column).
  - **Per-stage payload bridges (in progress):**
    - `semantic_frontend` ✅ — `stage_attempts.output_json` →
      `Snapshot.take_set` (mapping domain `ReviewedTake` →
      contract `ReviewedTake`) + `Snapshot.episode` (from
      `payload.episode_basename`). Domain `ScriptRole::Detail`
      (no contract counterpart) is mapped to `practical`.
- Every outbound frame is validated against the bundled server schema
  in debug builds.

**Still to do in Phase 2** (each item is a separate vertical slice):

- script blocks aren't persisted by `semantic_frontend` today (only the
  resolved take_set is). Either (a) extend the stage's `Payload` to
  include the parsed `Vec<ScriptBlock>`, or (b) have `qua-api` re-read
  the YAML from object storage. Option (a) is preferred.
- `Decision::Reject` has no contract counterpart — currently dropped;
  may want a `StageFailed` bridge instead;
- per-stage payload work — `extract_and_preview` next, then the order
  listed below.

The `qua-api` crate's WebSocket handler will implement the same
`ServerMessage` enum the mock implements. As stages get built
(`semantic_frontend` first), they emit real events using the same shapes
the mock fabricates.

**Critical insight: vertical migration, not horizontal.** The backend
doesn't need feature parity to be useful. It can implement only:

- `snapshot`
- `state_change` / `stage_started` / `stage_finished`
- `worker_heartbeat`

…and still be testable end-to-end with the UI. Stages not yet implemented
send no events; UI shows them as pending. Migrate **one stage at a time**,
not all messages then no stages.

Suggested order (matches the pipeline):

1. `semantic_frontend` — script ingest → snapshot + script blocks
2. `extract_and_preview` — take ingest → takes + thumbnails
3. `audio_alignment` → alignment_attempt + alignment_edit_proposed
4. `subtitles` → subtitle cues
5. `compositor` → compositor_chroma_key, _background_replace, _preview
6. `eye_alignment` → face_detected, eye_line_analysis, alignment_applied
7. `color_grade` → color_analysis, look_match_computed, grade_applied
8. `audio_master` → loudness_measured, noise_profile, master_applied
9. `export` → render_started, render_progress, render_completed, export_summary
10. `qa` → qa state in snapshot only

### Phase 3 — The swap

Already wired in Phase 1c. Set `VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/v1/ws`.
Run both simultaneously during transition: mock on `:3001` for UI iteration,
real backend on `:8080` for end-to-end testing. Switch via env var.

### Phase 4 — Mock becomes a contract test fixture

Once the real backend implements all messages, **don't delete the mock —
promote it to a contract conformance harness.** Two purposes:

1. **Offline UI development:** Frontend continues to develop against the
   mock for visual concerns (no Postgres + Kafka stack required for CSS work).
2. **Contract regression suite:** Test that connects to the real backend
   and asserts its messages conform to the same schemas the mock produces.
   Run against staging on every backend PR.

---

## How drift is prevented

### 1. Schema-first PRs

Adding a new WS message starts with a PR **here** (qua-media-contracts).
That PR generates new TS + Rust types. Until those types are tagged,
neither downstream repo can reference the new message. **The contract
leads.**

### 2. Schema validation at runtime in dev

Both the UI client and the mock server run every outbound + inbound
message through Ajv (TS) or `jsonschema` (Rust) and log a warning on
mismatch. Production strips this. Drift is caught the first time the
dev server runs.

**TS dev-mode wiring (sketch):**

```ts
import Ajv2020 from "ajv/dist/2020.js";
import serverSchema from "@qua/media-contracts/schemas/v1/ws/server.schema.json";

const ajv = new Ajv2020({ strict: false });
const validate = ajv.compile(serverSchema);

ws.addEventListener("message", (ev) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(ev.data);
  if (import.meta.env.DEV && !validate(data)) {
    console.warn("[contract drift]", validate.errors, data);
  }
  // ...
});
```

**Rust dev-mode wiring (sketch):**

```rust
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
{
    let v: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(&frame_text)?;
    if let Err(errs) = qua_media_contracts::validate::server_message(&v) {
        eprintln!("[contract drift] {errs:?}");
    }
}
```

### 3. Contract tests in CI for both repos

- **UI repo CI:** spin up the mock, run a Playwright test that captures
  every WS frame, validate each against its schema. Fails if mock drifts.
- **Backend repo CI:** spin up `qua-api` against a test database, replay
  a scripted scenario, capture every WS frame, validate each. Fails if
  backend drifts.

Both repos validate independently against the same source of truth.

---

## Why this works for AI-assisted iteration

- **UI agent has a complete runnable system locally.** Mock + real-shaped
  data + full WebSocket flow. Iterates on visual design, interactions,
  layouts without touching backend code or running Postgres. Fast loop.
- **Backend agent has a complete testable contract.** Knows exactly what
  messages to emit, what shapes the API must serve. No React knowledge
  required.
- **The contract repo is the only coordination point.** A new feature is
  a 3-PR sequence: contract → backend → UI (or contract → UI → backend).
  Each agent only needs one PR's worth of context.
- **Schema-driven prompts work better.** "Implement the `compositor_adjust`
  handler — see `schemas/v1/ws/client.schema.json#/$defs/CompositorAdjust`
  for the input shape and `server.schema.json#/$defs/CompositorPreview` for
  the response." The contract IS the spec. No ambiguity.

## What stays in each repo

### qua-media-contracts (this repo)

- JSON Schemas (`schemas/v1/**`)
- OpenAPI spec (`schemas/v1/http/openapi.yaml`)
- Codegen config (`packages/ts/scripts/`, `crates/qua-media-contracts/build.rs`)
- Type packages (TS, Rust)
- Schema validation (`packages/ts/scripts/validate.mjs`, optional Rust
  `validate` feature)
- Documentation: "what does message X mean semantically" (this folder)

### qua-media-pipeline-ui

- React client (`client/`) — uses `@qua/media-contracts`
- Mock server (`server/`) — uses `qua-media-contracts` Rust crate
- Visual design system, components
- E2E tests against the mock
- Storybook for components
- Contract conformance test that connects to a real backend URL when one
  is provided (Phase 4)

### qua-media-rs (future)

- `qua-api`, `qua-worker`, `qua-fsm`, etc.
- Real Postgres + Kafka + FFmpeg integrations
- All depend on `qua-media-contracts` Rust crate
- Backend conformance test in CI (Phase 2 onward)

---

## Versioning

`schemas/v1/` is the v1 wire format. Breaking changes get a new directory
(`schemas/v2/`) and a new generated module/package alongside v1. Generated
artifacts are tagged together (`v1.x.y`) so a single git tag pins both
TS and Rust consumers.

Today: `v0.x.y` — pre-1.0, the contract is allowed to break with each tag
during initial migration. Promote to `v1.0.0` once Phase 1 lands and the
backend has implemented at least the snapshot + state_change + heartbeat
core (start of Phase 2).
